Description: Fix CVE-2019-9433.
  Fix use-after-free in postproc.
  The pointer in vp8 postproc refers to show_frame_mi which is only
  updated on show frame. However, when there is a no-show frame which also
  changes the size (thus new frame buffers allocated), show_frame_mi is
  not updated with new frame buffer memory.
  Change the pointer in postproc to mi which is always updated.
